Onboarding Day Agenda :-
Company context : There had been recent data breach in the company, and the data privacy has become the most important thing to secure for the company and it's future. 

The policy from now on is strict monitoring and logging of all process flow  should be done in the organization by first creating a dedicated channel for that process / objective, and add all stake holders of that process in the channel. All process steps upon ideation and on any update should be sent as real time chat message to the channel. 
All meetings between the channel members should also be added as message in the channel, and any update on the same should also be send.  (Any action pertaining to the call, scheduled call for 30 min at 3:30 pm 2 Oct 2025) . like call participant add, call cancelled. (The last 2 action set message should include the call external ID.
 The idea is to make every transaction recorded in the space, so deleting of no text message in the channel is allowed; but when the chat message delete request is for a cancelled IT meeting call with the IT incharge, it should be mandatorily deleted.   

Eery channel should start with the <personname>- prefix to the functionality name identigiers as described later in this paragraph.
The onboarding process should initiate channels for the user with respective stake holders.  (IT admin, manager, buddy)
There is only 1 IT person on any given day, so only the IT person available on the onbaording day should be added to the onboarding channel and the IT Security Training channel. 
The onboarding channel after creation,should first add <Me> as the first user. Then the stakeholders. 
The onboarding user must complete - IT training and test (most important)  30 mins, meeting with manager (medium urgency)  25min ; buddy meet (least precedence)  30 min. 
The meetings should be structured in such a way that we prioritize completing the IT Security meeting as the first agenda. Only  way any meeting should happen before the IT ity meeting is when the other stake holders are available at any early time than the IT person, or the IT meeting got cancelled. In case of the cancellation, we should reshuffle all the stake holder meetings such that we set up the IT meeting at the earliest next possible time with maximize the meeting count in the least amount of time.  secur

After the successful IT meeting, I will pass in the grades received from the IT person which should be added to the chat message in the IT channel.

After every process completion , we should rename the channel with an added suffix of the completition date ; themn close the channel; and then archive it. 

The onboarding process will get completed after those 3 meetings, and the IT security  process after the grade message is sent to the channel.
